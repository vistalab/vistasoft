% function flat = vol2flatTSeriesLevels(gray,flat,[selectedScans])

% This converts tSeries from a volume to flat view separately
% for each gray level in the segmentation, and also computes
% a mean tSeries across the gray levels.
%
% After examining the code, I feel the way this is done is reasonably
% correct (it interpolates data separately for each gray level). The
% original code for this came with a warning that it was not implemented
% properly; the main error I saw was that it interpolated even though
% many gray nodes might project to the same x/y coordinates on the 
% interpolated surface.
%
% There is a flatMulti view for viewing this data. See 
% openFlatLevelWindow.m.
%
% selectedScans: 
%   0 - do all scans
%   number or list of numbers - do only those scans
%   default - prompt user via selectScans dialog
%
% If you change this function make parallel changes in:
%    ip2volCorAnal, ip2volParMap, ip2volSpatialGradient, ip2volTSeries, 
%    vol2flatCorAnal, vol2flatParMap
