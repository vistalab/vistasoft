% Modification to matlab's griddata to toss parts of the
% resulting image that are far from the initial sample points.
% Assumes coords go from (1,1) to imSize.  Assigns NaNs to pixels
% that are far from the sample points.
%
% coords: 2xN array of (y,x) sample point coordinates
% data: 1xN array of data values
% mask: mask image (size of resulting image) that has 1s where you want
%   to keep the data and NaNs elsewhere.
% 
% rmk 12/1/98 added the check for NaNs and eliminated them if found
%             in the coords which was causing it to crash
%
% rmk & wap 3/11/99 removed the warnings from griddata
%
% wap & bw & hb 5/14/99
%   Finding allf below had a bug.  We worked on it.

% djh, 7/99
%   Modified to use precomputed mask image, rather than recomputing it
%   every time.
% Resulting image is the same size as the mask
