function fgOut = fgExtract(fg,list,operation)
% Select a subset of fibers and create a new group by either keeping fibers
% in list, or removing them.
%
%   fgOut = fgExtract(fg,list,[operation='keep'])
%
% INPUTS:
%       fg:        a fiber group structure (or pdb/mat file)
%       list:      the specific fibers you want to extract in a 1xN list
%                  of indices
%       operation: the operation to be performed. You can either 'keep' or
%                  'remove' the fibers in list
%                    * Accepted inputs for 'operation': *
%                      'keep'  - the fibers corresponding to the entries
%                                in list are kept (the others are removed)
%                     'remove' - the fibers corresponding to the entries
%                                in list are removed.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       fgOut:     the fg fibers that are in the list, with certain other
%                  fields preserved.
%
% USAGE NOTES:
%   Quench statistics (if any) are NO LONGER cleared as part of the
%   extraction.
%
%   N.B. There may be problems with this routine preserving some of the
%   associated variables (e.g., seeds, Q, and other properties computed
%   from the fibers).  We preserve some of them, but we clear others and/or
%   possibly make some worthless (e.g. pathway statistics in params).
%   Specifically, those entries in fg.params that do not have statistics
%   are removed as part of this process (e.g., {'faThresh'  [0.1500]
%   'lengthThreshMm'  [50 250]  'stepSizeMm'  [1]}).

%% Get the indicies for the fibers to be removed

% inds. If the user said 'keep', then we need to flip the list from keep to
% remove.
switch operation

    % be removed so we set inds equal to list
    inds = list;
end


%% Format the fiber indices.

% Fibers with the highest index are removed first. This must be done so
% that the size of the array does not change before a given entry is
% removed - which would result in a "index exceeds matrix dimensions"
% error.

% Make fiber inds 1xN
% Force inds to be ordered largest to smallest
inds = sort(inds(:),'descend')';


%% Notes on stats fields

% These are leftover stats notes from previous code. The issues here were
% circumvented using the code in the following cells.

% Given a list of inds, we want to remove the specified fibers and their
% entries in the 'pathwayInfo', 'params', 'Q' and 'seeds' fields.

% Statistics are no longer valid. [OR ARE THEY???] This should be tested
% further.

% Clear the existing stats from the fg. If we don't do this here we get
% some weird display characteristics when we open them in Quench. (They
% won't display per-point) [NOTE: I think this is fixed by the code in the
% next two cells.] This will clear fg.params and fg.pathwayInfo and we
% don't want that, especially since we put some work into getting those
% stats.

% This is no longer necessary because of the code in the next 2 cells
% fg = dtiClearQuenchStats(fg);


%% Params field

% Let's explain this better - BW
%
% Most FGs will have a params field, but we check to be
% consistent. If we want this to be even more general we have to loop
% over it and see which params fields have an entry that's the size of
% the fg.fibers field, or at least larger than 1. This could be done by
% determining the number of elements in fg.params, then looping over
% fg.params{n} and checking to see if that entry has a 'stat' field -
% and if so we remove the corresponding entry listed in 'inds' - which we
% do in the following loop. Here we remove the params fields that don't
% have individual fiber params in them - this deals with the dispay issue
% in Quench and allows us to retain the params and pathwayInfo fields as we
% don't have to run dtiClearQuenchStats.

% Initialize counter:
% c = 0;
if isfield(fg,'params') && ~isempty(fg.params)
  % Remove fg.params entries from the largest to smallest, thus
  % avoiding an index exceeds matrix dimensions error.

      % Add 1 to the counter and set the entry in idx - which

%% REMOVAL:  PathwayInfo field
% Each of the params fields must be removed from pathwayInfo as well. But
% it's not the top level that has to be removed but rather the entries in
% the pathwayInfo.pathStat and the pathwayInfo.point_stat_array structs
% that correspond to the removed params fields have to be removed.
% These fields have different dimensions.
%
% FIX FIX FIX-----------------------
% This is confusing. Do pathwayInfo OR pathStat have the length of fibers?
% Itis not clear here. The fiber groups I am handling have as many
% pathwayInfo as fibers. So this code is not optimal (we could delete the
% whole pathway info instead of going into each field.)
% e.g., fg.pathwayInfo(inds) = [];
% Franco
if isfield(fg,'pathwayInfo')
  for jj = 1:numel(fg.pathwayInfo)
