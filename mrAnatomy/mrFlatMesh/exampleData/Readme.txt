I added leftTest.Gray and leftTest.MrM to the repository (July, 18, 2005)
These are from Dan Donoho's data (classprojects, left)

The good start point for testing this is (217,122,95) = XYZ
You can run it with a 25 mm unfold radius.
Seems OK for testing.

To further test the cartesian option, I used a start point on these data of
213,138,126 (posterior calcarine)

an X-axis location of 206,126,155 (which is anterior in the calcarine) would be good.
But for now, that feature isn't implemented.  When we start testing, try that location.

For the rightXX and testXXX stuff, these are old notes:
I am not sure which files they apply to.
Good start points for this gray/mesh combo are....
X: 221
Y: 144
Z: 133
