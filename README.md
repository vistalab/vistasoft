## Vistasoft

VISTASOFT is the main software repository of the [Vista lab](http://vistalab.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu). It contains Matlab code to perform a variety of analysis on MRI data, including functional MRI and diffusion MRI.

It has the following modules:

- mrAlign : Aligning functional and anatomical data
- mrAnatomy: Handling anatomical MRI data. 
- mrBOLD : analysis of functional MRI data.
- mrDiffusion : Diffusion MRI, including DTI and tractography.
- mrMesh : displaying MR data on rendered 3D surface representations of the brain.
- mrQuant : quantitative MRI (see also [mrQ](https://github.com/vistalab/mrQ))
- mrScripts : a variety of useful scripts

And in addition:
- utilities
- setup
- tutorials 
- external: functions written by others that we use as dependencies.

External dependencies:
- Matlab (2009 or newer)
- SPM8
